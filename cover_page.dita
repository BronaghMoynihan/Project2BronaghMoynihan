    <shortdesc>This is a document produced by Bronagh Moynihan based on pages 1-22 of the IBM
        document Deployment and ConÔ¨Åguration Guide (available online <xref
            href="https://www.ibm.com/support/%20pages/sites/default/files/inline-files/$FILE/IBMSIQDeploymentConfigGuide76019_%201.pdf"

    <conbody>
        <p>Conditions were applied to the text using a DITAVAL document. I devised a conditional
            processing scheme based on the following attributes: </p>
        <ul id="ul_kkz_xq1_wjb">
            <li>Windows</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
        </ul>
        <ul id="ul_cnt_yq1_wjb">
            <li>System Administrator (Sys_Admin)</li>
            <li>End User (End_User</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Windows and Linux content was excluded/included as it pertained to the user. Technically
            advanced content was conditioned for System Administrators while content deemed basic
            was conditioned for End Users. The last topic in full is conditioned for system
            administrator. System admin content is flagged in red and yellow.</p>
