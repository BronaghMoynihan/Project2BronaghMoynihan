            <p class="p"> Go to the page at Software Product Compatibility Reports to create a high-level
                report for supported operating systems, related software, hypervisors, and supported
                translations for any product. You can also create an in-depth report to get detailed
                system requirements, hardware requirements, and end of service information for each
                product. You can search for a product in all of the report types and reports are
                generated based on your query values. The following report types are the most
                commonly generated reports from software product compatibility reports:</p>
            <ul class="ul" id="planning_for_deployment__ul_o22_l4t_vjb">
                <li class="li">Detailed system requirements<p class="p">When you select your product version for the
                        detailed system requirements report, you can set a report filter for
                        Operating system platforms, Product components, and Capabilities, including
                        prerequisites and support software. After you view the report, you can save
                        it as a URL to generate anytime or download it as a PDF. </p></li>
                <li class="li">Hardware requirements <p class="p">When you select your product version for the hardware
                        requirements report, you can set a report filter by the Operating system
                        families option. Set the operating system filter by selecting some or all of
                        the operating systems that are supported by your product. After you view the
                        report, you can save it as a URL to generate anytime or download it as a
                        PDF. </p></li>
                <li class="li">End of service<p class="p">The end of service report shows the service window of the
                        products that you specify over an eightyear span. For example, you can find
                        out when your product is scheduled to go out of service. </p></li>
