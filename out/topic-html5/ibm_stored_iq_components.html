    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The IBM StoredIQ solution consists of these components: the application stack, the
        gateway, the data server, and optionally the Elasticsearch cluster.</p>
        <section class="section" id="ibm_stored_iq_components__section_wx1_5kt_vjb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Solution Components</h2>
            
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ provides three solution components: the gateway, data servers, and
                application stack (AppStack). </p>
            <p class="p"><span class="keyword">Gateway</span>
            </p>
            <p class="p">The gateway communicates between the data servers and the application stack. The
                application stack polls the gateway for information about the data on the data
                servers. The data servers push the information to the gateway. </p>
            <p class="p"><span class="keyword">Data servers</span>
            </p>
            <p class="p">A data server obtains the data from supported data sources and indexes it. By
                indexing this data, you gain information about unstructured data such as file size,
                file data types, file owners. </p>
            <p class="p">The data server pushes the information about volumes and indexes to the gateway so it
                can be communicated to the application stack. Multiple data servers feed into a
                single gateway. </p>
            <p class="p">Data servers can be categorized in two types: DataServer - Classic and DataServer -
                Distributed. A data server of the type DataServer - Classic uses the embedded
                PostgreSQL database for storing the index. With a data server of the type DataServer
                - Distributed, the index is stored in an Elasticsearch cluster. Data servers of this
                type also provide better performance in search queries. They can manage much larger
                amounts of data than data servers of the type DataServer - Classic, thus making the
                IBM StoredIQ deployments more scalable. </p>
            <p class="p">You can have both types of data servers in your IBM StoredIQ deployment. </p>
            <p class="p">In addition to completing standard administrative tasks, administrators can deploy
                the IBM StoredIQ Desktop Data Collector and index desktops from the data server.</p>
            <p class="p"><span class="keyword">Application stack </span></p>
            <p class="p">The application stack provides the user interface for the IBM StoredIQ Administrator,
                IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench, IBM StoredIQ Insights, and the IBM StoredIQ Policy
                Manager products. The synchronization feature for integration with a governance
                catalog is also part of the application stack. </p>
            <p class="p"><span class="keyword">Elasticsearch cluster</span>
            </p>
            <p class="p">The Elasticsearch cluster attached to a data server of the type DataServer -
                Distributed provides a single data store for all metadata and content of harvested
                objects. Indexed data is distributed automatically across the nodes in the cluster.
                Indexing and queries are load-balanced across all nodes. Nodes can be added
                dynamically without downtime and the indexing process can use these newly added
                nodes without further setup. </p>

            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ provides interface applications that help fulfill its solution
                goals.</p>
            <p class="p"><span class="keyword">IBM StoredIQ Data Server</span></p>
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Server user interface provides access to data server functionality.
                It allows administrators to view the dashboard and see the status of the jobs and
                system details. Administrators  can manage information about servers and conduct
                various configurations on the system and application settings.</p>
